# Nitisinone Surveys
In the directory `surveys` you will find an example nitisinone status survey with real AKU cervical and lumbar images that was sent to participants (Nitisinone Survey Example.pdf). You will also find a copy of all the responses, including the commentary that participants left about why they made certain predictions about a patient's nitisinone status (Nitisinone_Survey_Results.xlsx). Additionally, within this document, you can also find the participants self-rated confidence level about the survey.
